# Lightweight Django Project 3

## Scrum Board

This project is using Django, the Django REST Framework, and Backbone.js to create a simple scrum board.

The idea is to learn more about Django as a REST client and Backbone as a frontend framework.

So far, the tutorial and explanations have been fantastic, and I am learning a lot about Django and how it works with frontend frameworks.

Django isn't built to be the mega ultimate awesome REST client that Web 3.0 needs, but with the REST Framework or something like TastyPi, it can do well.

I am using Django 1.8.7, Python 3.5, and PostgreSQL.
